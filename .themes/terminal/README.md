****Installation****

[Install rEFInd](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html) as you would normally.

1. Find your refind EFI directory, Create a folder named `themes`  inside
2. Clone this repository or paste the contents there.
3. Edit `refind.conf` and add this as the last line include  `include themes/custom/theme.conf `



You might want to edit the [background image](./background.png).

Updates:
1) added theme.conf
2) added custom logos- ubuntu logo, added win8 logo- windows 11 identified as win8 for some reason
